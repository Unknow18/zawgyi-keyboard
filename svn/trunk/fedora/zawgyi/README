For RPM Builders:
-----------------
Before you create PRM packages on Fedora, you will need to install some core development tools as root.

$ su
# yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
# yum install rpmdevtools
# yum install rpmlint

Then create the directory structure in your home directory as your user (not as root)

$ rpmdev-setuptree

The "rpmdev-setuptree" program will create an "rpmbuild" directory in your $HOME directory. Underneath "rpmbuild" are a set of subdirectories (such as BUILDROOT, BUILD, RPMS, SOURCES, SPECS, SRPMS).

The sources (zawgyi-keyboard*.zip) will be copied to SOURCES and zawgyi.spec will be copied to SPECS of rpmbuild directory. For example;

$ cp zawgyi-keyboard*.zip ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
$ cp zawgyi.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS

-go to SPECS directory;
$ cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS

-command to build rpm and source packages

$ rpmbuild -ba --clean zawgyi.spec

The binary rpm package will have in RPMS folder and source package scr.rpm will have in SPRMS.

-testing rpms

$ cd ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch
$ rpmls *.rpm

-run rpmlint, rpmlint works on .spec file, binary RPMs and source ROMS, finding different things in each.

$ rpmlint *.rpm

You may find some errors from rpmlint running result so that you could fix them.
