#########################

Go to System -> Preferences-> Keyboard, click on Keyboard, then Keyboard Preferences would be appear.
Go to Layout Tab and click on Add button. Choose a Layout “Myanmar” and press Add button.
You will have both US English Layout and Myanmar Zawgyi Layout. To get keyboard switching, press Layout Options in the Layout Tab of Keyboard Preferences. Check e.g. Ctrl+Shift Change Layout in Layout Switching.
For old zawgyi font till ZawgyiOne20080210.ttf, we had to have Third Level Chooser. But Right now we don't have to have Third Level Chooser for new zawgyi font (July 2009 version). It would be fine using `shift+f` instead.

NOTE: It depends on you and your preferences.

If you want to get Keyboard Indicator on your panel, right-click on Panel and click on “Add to Panel”. Search Keyboard Indicator and press it to add.
You will see Keyboard Indicator on your Panel.

TIPS:
It is good to remove previous zawgyi keyboard installed when you install new package.
Also you may need to log out your system after installing new zawgyi-keyboard package.

You can test some words in Gedit to know if it corrects or not. When you get correct words, it is done.

Enjoy!
